				Shree Vitthalnathji (also popularly know as Shree gusainji) is the second son of sri Vallabhacharya. He wad born at Charanata near Allahabad on magshar Vadi Nom , 1572, Samvat. Vallabhacharya in his later life adopted Adel as his permanent residence, and therefore he passed his childhood there & was given Upnayan sanskar at the age of 8 at Varanasi.It is an undisputed fact that like his father , he had a very great hold on and absorbing attachment to Srimad Bhagavata. Shree Gusainji became the representative of his father, and thereafter he palnned various tours in India , and thought of writing works for the propagation of the Sampradaya. He toured the whole of India to spread the message of Pushti Marg and also wrote many literary works. he introduced present times SEVA as a means of experiancing love for God.

					He was convinced and introduced different forms of art such as music, drawing and dancing in SEVA.During his own time as the head of the sect, he added four more poet saints to the divine court of ShreeNathji other that the 4 poets designated by Shri Mahaprabhuji and brought the final number of poet saints to eight which are even today popularly know as 'Ashta Sakha" The great kirtans of Krishna Leela are sung to this day in Vaishnav havelis.Some of the best known manoraths in our sect were also initiated during Shri Gusaiji's tenure as head of the sect. Shri Gusaiji had many disciples around the country. His most celebrated disciples and their spiritual experiences are recorded in the 252 Vaishnav's varta. Later Compiled by Shri Hariraiji, these vaishnavs are held up as the role models for all other vaishnavs to follow.

At that time India was ruled by Akber & he was a great man.His desire for knowledge was sincere and visited Gokul to meet Shree Gusainji. Gusaiji's first meeting with the emperor Akber is highlighted to explain the some of the most profound philosophical ideas of the marg and helps explain how masses turned to Pushtimarg to attatin the almighty.Seeing & experincing Gusainji's Spiritual knowledge and popularity abongst people, Akbar honoured him and gave him the title of "Goswami", which is even well known today. Shri Gusaiji was an exceptional person who managed to expand the popularity of the sect in a way very differently to his father and brother.
He had a knack of explaining the most difficult philosophical point in very simple terms. Even the most ordinary people could understand and appreciate his teachings. His refined tastes and excellent abilities to explain philosophical matters helped him win some very powerful friends in the political circles of the times. Some of his devotees included members of the imperial family at Agra, members of the imperial court, and several important Hindu royal families of the times.The Taj-begum (Maharani Jodhabai - chief queen of Akber) was an ardent disciple of Shri Gusaiji, as was Birbal, Raja Mansingh (brother of empress Jodhabai), and Ajabkuvarbai (wife of the King of Mewar). The sect grew under the protection of such influential and powerful patrons. Later, during Auranzeb's monstrous rule, it was the patronage of such powerful families that helped save the sacred icons of the sect. Most of the icons and the goswamies initially emigrated to Amer, Mewar and Marwad to escape the marching armies of the new ruler of Delhi.
The current haveli of Shri Nathji is reputed to stand on the very spot where Ajabkuvarbai's palace once used to stand.

					Shree Gusainji was married twice and hiw wives were Shri Rukmini Vahuji and Shri Padmavati Vahuji and he had seven sons and 4 daughters. during his own lifetime, he decided to make Gokul his head-quarters and to make the matters of inheritance as smooth as possible, he gave each of his sons one of the sacred icons and established a separate haveli for each one of them in Gokul. Shri Nathji remained at Jatipura during Shri Gusaiji's lifetime. Because of these there are seven seats or piths in Pushtimarg. The generations following shree Mahaprabhuji and Shree Gusainji continued to spered Pushti Philosophy throughout India and thus the path of Grace has become a strong force today, leading people to a life completely devoted to Shree Thakuji.
