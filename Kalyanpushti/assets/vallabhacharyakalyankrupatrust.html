		In the last decade New Zealand has seen a pleasant proliferation of immigrants of Indian origin. Concurrent with that, there has been a surge of social, cultural and religious activities involving the Indian expatriates. The birth of VPNZ is a God's Gift bestowed upon this vibrant expatriate community.

        "Pushtimargiya" practices were formulated and graced by 'Acharya Shree Mahaprabhuji' about 500 years ago. These practices are a way of life and a way to practice religion for myriads of Vaishnav Hindus world over.

	    Since Feb.'04, fortnightly satsang and path have been held on a Saturday evening in a hall hired for the purpose. The fortnightly satsang initially lasted 1.5 hours. This has now been extended to 2 hours. Satsang includes a set of definite recitations at the start and the end of the 2 hour period. Time is also devoted to singing a variety of bhajans and reading relevant excerpts from Pushtimargiya literature. This programme provides for maintaining consistency with diversity and interest. A recent addition to the programme is the concurrent, entertaining and adult-supervised activity for the children of the attending Vaishnav families. This is held in a separate room within the same facility. The audiovisual programme for children is sourced from an array of religious videos / DVDs eg Mahabharat etcâ€¦ It is coupled with due explanation by the supervising adult. For any such collective activity to remain sustainable, it needs be carried out by a robust organisation consisting of dedicated members with genuine belief and conviction. To this effect Vaishnav Parivar (NZ) Inc. became a formal organisation on 21st May 2004.
