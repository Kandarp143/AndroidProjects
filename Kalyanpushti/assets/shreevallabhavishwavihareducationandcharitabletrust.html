			In modern trend of Western and POP music has almost eclipsed the traditional ancient music of India.
			To protect and rehabilitate Indian classical music it must be promoted at all levels of life.

			The divinity of Venunaad must thus be preserved through repeated performances by experts in classical music and flushed in suitably into modern film music if possible to popularize it.
