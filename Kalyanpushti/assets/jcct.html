India is a holy land for the various incarnations of the Almighty.

Gujaratis are better known for inspiring devotional hearts for the activities of the welfare of the human beings and their society through the medium of spiritualism. Godhara (Panch Mahal-Gujarat) is well known for Karma, Gyan and Bhakti where practitioners of Pushti-Bhakti traditions like Shri Mahaprabhuji, Shri Gunsaiji, and Shri Ghanshyamlalji had enlightened all by sawing the seeds of Pushtimarg and sharing the fruits of the same respectively.

It is pilgrimage where devotees will be able to worship Gods and Goddesses of Sanatan Vedic Hinduism along with Shri Nathji, Shri Govardhannathaji, Shri Girirajji, Shri Ganpatiji, Shri Ram Darbar (including Shri Hanuman) etc.
