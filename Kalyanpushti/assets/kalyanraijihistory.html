    <strong>Pragatya of Lord Shree Kalyanrayji Prabhu:</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Incidence of Pragatya of Lord Kalyanrayji Prabhuji is wonderful and unique. It has direct relation with stories of 84 vaishnavs of Mahaprabhuji.
</p>
<p>
    In eastern part of Kashi and Prayag there was a small village. Where Babuvenu, Krishnadas and Yadavendradas were staying and all were very divine souls.
    Babuvenu and Krishnadas were very close and best friends of each other. Yadavendradas was khawashi.
</p>
<p>
    One day Lord Shree Kalyanrayji Prabhu said in dream to Babuvenu I am Kalyani Devi. I am in bottom of this lake. Take me out and do my seva services.
    Babuvenu told this dream to his friend Krishnadas. They jumped in to the lake water and tried to find lord and at last Babuvenu found the idol of the Lord
    Shree Kalyanrayji Prabhuji. With their own small wealth they have constructed small temple on the bank of the lake and Lord known as Goddess Kalyanjidevi.
    Babuvenu, Kirshnadas and Yadavendradas were doing seva services of goddess Kalyanidevi.
</p>
<p>
    After five years, when Babuvenu, Krishnadas and Yadavendradas were gone out of town and Shree Mahaprabhuji was travelling from Kashi to Adel; he was
    resting below the mango tree near temple. At that time Lord Shree Kalyanrayji Prabhuji called Shree Mahaprabhuji and said come inside the temple. When
    Shree Mahaprabhuji went inside the temple and shows Lord wore costumes of female and sited like goddess. Shree Mahaprabhuji asked Lord. Why you are in the
    Goddess pose and costumes? Lord replied to him that nobody’s knows Thakurji here. I took seva services in the form of Goddess from Babuvenu, Krishnadas and
    Yadavendradas to liberate their souls, Babuvenu is follower of goddess. Now give me a form of Thakurji, wait for few moments sit below the mango tree and
    accept them and go further. Shree Mahaprabhuji had changed the costumes of lord from sari to dhoti and wore him as a Thakurji and sited below the tree.
</p>
<p>
    After some time Babuvenu, Krishnadas and Yadavendradas came back and went inside the temple. Babuvenu asked who had changed the costumes of goddess. At
    that moment Lord Thakurji said do not touch me I am Shree Kalyanrayji Thakurji. Babuvenu said in this village nobody knows Thakurji than why you are refuse
    to touch me. Lord Shree Kalyanrayji said you go and meet the Shree Acharaya who is sited below the tree and take his guidance and surrender yourself as his
    disciple. All went to the acharaya and became his disciple and stared seva of Shree Kalyanrayji Prabhuji and became a vaishnavs.
</p>
<p>
    Once Kota King came for darshan of Shree Kalyanrayji Prabhuji but temple was closed. Shree Girdharlalji was doing seva services of the Thakurji. Shree
    Girdharlalji requested king to take rest and wait for darshan but king wanted to do the darshan. At last king went back without Darshan it was not possible
    for Shree Girdharlalji to wake up the Shree kalyanrayji as per the rules and systems of the pustimarg. Kota king was very angry; he had stopped all
    security and donations of the temple of Shree Kalyanrayji Prabhu.
</p>
<p>
    Due to lack of security temple was frequently robbed by dacoits of Chambal valley. Tilakayat Shree Goverdhanlalji wrote a letter to King of Mewad Shree
    Bhopalsinhji. In the kingdom of Mewad they have five swaroops of Lord. After permission of Shree Goverdhanlalji King of Mewad requested King of Gaekwad
    State Shree Sayajirao. He accepted the request letter and his reply were forwarded by King of Mewad and to Shree Girdharlalji. Both of them had meeting and
    decided to shift Lord Shree Kalyanrayji Prabhu from SherGadh to Vadodara.
</p>
<p>
    At that time Temple of Shree Dauji was very prominent and it was decided by king of vaodara to provide accommodation and all necessary facilities to Lord
    Shree Kalyanrayji Prabhuji at Dauji Temple. Due to indiscipline attitude of King of Kota Lord Kalyanrayji Prabhu was shifted from Shergadh to Vadodara.
    Without knowledge of King of Kota Lord Shree kalyanrayji Prabhuji was shifted from Shergadh. From Khanpur to Kota Lord travelled by Bullock cart from Kota
    to Vadodara travelled by train.
</p>
<p>
    Citizens of Vadodara and King of Gaekwad State Shri Sayajirao Gaekwad had saluted the Lord with 21 Guns and honored with highly spiritual respect and
    ceremonies. Lord Shree Kalyanrayji Prabhu was shifted to Dauji Temple. Today it is known as Shahsthapeeth Shree Kalyanrayji Mandir.
